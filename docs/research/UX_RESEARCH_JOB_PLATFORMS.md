  - **Application Tracking**: Comprehensive dashboard to view submitted applications, dates, and sometimes status.
  - **Recommendations**: AI-driven job recommendations based on skills, experience, and interactions. Job alerts for matching criteria.
- **Match Explanation Approach**:
  - AI-powered "match score" based on profile components (headline, titles, skills, education, certifications), behavioral data (views, applications), completeness, and recency of activity.
  - Social proof (endorsements, recommendations) also contributes to match score.
- **Screenshots/Examples**: (Observed: Filters on the left sidebar, job details on the right, clear "Easy Apply" button, progress bars for profile completion, dedicated "My Jobs" section for tracking.)
