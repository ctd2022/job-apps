# UX Research: Job Platforms Analysis

## Executive Summary
**Key Findings:**
1. **Guided CV/Profile Builders:** Most candidate-matching platforms offer structured input forms, often with prompts for key achievements, skills, and experiences.
2. **Match Transparency:** LinkedIn and Hired provide partial match explanations, but detailed scoring and improvement tips are limited.
3. **Application Flow Friction:** ATS portals like Workday and Lever have multi-step forms with limited feedback, leading to candidate drop-off.
4. **Skills Validation:** Some platforms allow skill endorsements or integrate assessments (e.g., Hired, Wellfound), but the experience is inconsistent.
5. **Job Recommendations:** AI-driven suggestions appear across platforms, but explanations of relevance are often vague.

**Top 5 Recommendations:**
1. Provide clear, actionable match scores with detailed breakdowns (skills, experience, keywords).
2. Include prompts for ATS-friendly CV formatting.
3. Offer inline guidance during application flow to reduce drop-off.
4. Visualize skill gaps and suggest concrete improvements.
5. Give transparent explanations for job matches with examples from CV and job description.
