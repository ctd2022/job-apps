Hiring Manager  
BT Group plc  
London, England  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Programme Manager (Data and AI) position at BT Group. With over 15 years of experience in programme management across various sectors and a proven track record in delivering complex data projects, I believe I can significantly contribute to your team’s mission to transform how data is used to drive decisions and improve customer experiences.

One of my most notable achievements was leading the creation and integration of a Rapid Delivery Methodology for low-code BPM solutions. This initiative not only accelerated project delivery but also empowered non-technical stakeholders by reducing reliance on development resources, which aligns well with BT Group’s focus on empowering teams to execute data-driven insights effectively. Additionally, I successfully managed key accounts that generated over £5 million in revenue through strategic programme management, ensuring client satisfaction and renewals.

My experience spans both Agile and Waterfall methodologies, making me adept at hybrid approaches necessary for complex projects. At my current role as a Programme Director, I have consistently delivered multiple working streams on time, within budget, and to high-quality standards while managing diverse stakeholders up to MD level. This experience aligns perfectly with the BT Group’s requirement for a leader who can oversee programme finances, governance forums, and ensure clarity in delivery processes.

BT Group's vision to revolutionize connectivity through advanced digital infrastructure resonates deeply with my professional aspirations. The opportunity to lead strategic initiatives within the Data and AI domain not only leverages my technical skills but also aligns with my passion for continuous improvement and lean methodologies. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to BT’s ambitious projects and fostering a culture of innovation and excellence.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can be a valuable addition to your team at BT Group. Please feel free to contact me via [Phone Number] or [Email Address] for further information.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
