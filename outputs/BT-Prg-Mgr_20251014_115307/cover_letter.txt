Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Programme Manager (Data and AI) position at BT Group, as I believe my extensive background in project and programme management, coupled with my experience in delivering complex technology projects, makes me a strong fit for your team. My career has been marked by successful leadership roles that mirror the responsibilities outlined in this role, particularly in leading end-to-end programme delivery and stakeholder management.

One of my most notable achievements was overseeing the creation and integration of a rapid delivery methodology, which significantly streamlined our approach to capturing client requirements and delivering solutions via low-code platforms. This not only enhanced collaboration among internal teams but also led to substantial improvements in project efficiency and quality. Additionally, I have managed multiple concurrent technology projects, including strategic initiatives that required close coordination with stakeholders up to the MD level. For instance, my role in managing a mortgage solution programme involved creating two new online solutions and integrating them with client systems—a project that was part of a larger programme of change.

BT Group’s commitment to transforming how data is used to drive decisions and improve customer experiences aligns perfectly with my passion for leveraging technology and data-driven insights. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work within the Data & AI department, where I can apply my expertise in Agile and Waterfall methodologies, as well as my proficiency with Jira, to manage complex deliveries and drive continuous improvement.

I look forward to the possibility of contributing to BT’s mission and furthering our shared goal of delivering high-impact data projects. Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can contribute to your team.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
