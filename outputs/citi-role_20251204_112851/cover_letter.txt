Hiring Manager
Citi
[Address – if known, otherwise omit]
Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Program Manager Vice President position at Citi in Belfast, as advertised on LinkedIn. Having closely followed Citi’s commitment to responsible financial services and its impact on global economic progress, I am deeply impressed and eager to contribute my extensive program and project management experience to your team. The opportunity to join a dynamic, enterprise-level organization dedicated to driving complex initiatives aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and skillset.

Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered critical improvements through the leadership of online projects and programmes, ranging from rapid tactical solutions to multi-year strategic initiatives. Notably, I successfully led key account projects that consistently secured renewal of enterprise license agreements, generating over £5 million in revenue – a testament to my ability to deliver value and build strong client relationships. Furthermore, my experience managing the development and integration of a mortgage solution, encompassing new online solutions and system integrations, demonstrates my proficiency in navigating complex projects within a regulated environment, skills I believe are directly transferable to the regulatory and risk management focus outlined in the job description. I am adept at a pragmatic, hybrid approach, seamlessly blending Waterfall and Agile methodologies to optimise delivery based on project needs, and I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt to Citi’s established processes while proactively identifying areas for improvement.

I am particularly drawn to the collaborative and independent nature of the PMAE team, as described in the job description. My experience as Programme Director has honed my ability to operate autonomously, manage multiple stakeholders, and drive initiatives forward without constant direct oversight. I have a proven track record of building consensus and influencing cross-functional teams, as exemplified by my creation and integration of a rapid delivery methodology that fostered effective collaboration between internal teams. Moreover, my commitment to continuous improvement, evidenced by the development of a new risk management process and training program for project managers, aligns directly with Citi’s emphasis on innovation and employee development. My certifications – AgilePM®, PRINCE2, and Certified Scrum Master – demonstrate my dedication to best practice and provide a solid foundation for success within your team.

I am confident that my proven ability to lead complex programs, manage stakeholders effectively, and drive continuous improvement makes me an ideal candidate for this role. I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to Citi's continued success. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can readily meet the requirement of working on-site 3 days a week. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
